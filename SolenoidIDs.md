# Solenoids
Solenoids are double solenoids, they have two solenoids each (so two port numbers each), in code, you can toggle between the left and right solenoids by using `toggle`. Below are the port numbers for each double solenoid (although which port corresponds to which side is not labeled [this depends on mounting orientation]).
- `4`, `5`
- `2`, `3`
